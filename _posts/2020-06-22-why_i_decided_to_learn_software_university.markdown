I chose to learn how to code because I wanted to give myself a step up on others in the job market. My goal is to obtain my masters in Astronautical engineering once I finish up my bachelors degree. Being able to code in an engineering field is highly sought after nowadays due to the fact that everything we use now is electronically controlled. With the knowledge of how to code and projects to back it up will help me to build a more distinguished resume that can grab the attention of any future employers.
